Note: The site might need a few refreshes on the first try. This is because the server automatically goes to sleep after a certain period of time without connections. 

## Installation and Setup
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine to get the site running.

```bash

# Clone into this repository 
$ git clone https://github.com/Ace2489/chat-server.git 

# Go into the directory
$ cd chat-server

# Initialise the directory as an npm repository and install required packages
$ npm init -y
$ npm install

# Start the server
$ npm start
```
You can now access the server by entering 'localhost:3000' in your browser.
